## ‚ú® About The Project

In today's fast-paced digital world, public opinion can shift in an instant.  
This tool was built to provide a **live, at-a-glance understanding of the public conversation** around any topic.

By fetching data directly from **Twitter/X** and **Reddit**, it uses **Natural Language Processing** to analyze not just whether the sentiment is positive or negative, but also the **specific emotions** driving the conversation.

This project showcases a complete **full-stack development cycle**, from backend data processing and AI modeling to a polished, interactive frontend user experience.
