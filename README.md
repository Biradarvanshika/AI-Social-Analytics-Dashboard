‚ú® About The Project
In today's fast-paced digital world, public opinion can shift in an instant. This tool was built to provide a live, at-a-glance understanding of the public conversation around any topic. By fetching data directly from social media platforms like Twitter/X and Reddit, it uses Natural Language Processing to analyze not just whether the sentiment is positive or negative, but also the specific emotions driving the conversation.

This project showcases a complete full-stack development cycle, from backend data processing and AI modeling to a polished, interactive frontend user experience.
